# Prosper loan data EXPLORATION

## Dataset

My dataset consists of 113937 records of loans data with 81 columns of different features starting from the ListingKey which is the Unique key for each listing going through features about the loan , borrower, lender and investors details and these are some of the important features of each: Loans, Borrower, Lender, Investors. The dataset can be found here:

## Summary of Findings

A strong linear relationship between the borrower annual rate and the lender yield.
A 10.7% of the loans which represent more than 11K loans in the chargedoff state is a big number that indicate losses and bad impacts for the lender side.
Being employed is a main requirment and factor for the borrower to get a loan and we can see that a non small number of the borrowers employment status that they're self-employed. 
Most of the borrowers who applied on a loan in this dataset are Computer programmers , Executives and teachers.
The lenders can make more profit rates "yield" from the not employed category as definitely they apply higher borrower rates.
The higher the borrower rates the more likely the borrower not be able to pay off and the loan be charged off.



## Key Insights for Presentation

I am focusing on the bar charts at the begining of my presentation for the univariate exploration and trying to simplify some of the features by pie charts. Then I worked on histograms for the important qualitative variables and using the right bins. I explained the important key words in the preliminary wrangling that is going to be needed through the investigation. 

After targeting some important categorical features. I went to the bivariate exploration I focused on violin plots and box plots to show and illstrate the distribuation of different groups and categories. I simplified some columns and features and made a clustered bar chart that can be easily read. In the mutlivariate exploration I focused on coloring codes.
